# How to get your R code running faster

Code for walkthroughs from recent workshop.

The files in the R folder run in four parts, getting progressively more complicated:

1) `avoiding for loops.R`
2) `big data.R`
3) `do parallel.R`
4) `using loops the right way.R`

Also see my blog posts [part 1](https://andybaxter.me/2023/02/20/speed-up-r-1.html) and [part 2](https://andybaxter.me/2023/02/28/speed-up-r-2.html) for explanation of vectorisation and big data handling.
